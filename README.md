## Challenge Project Overview 

Using Jupyter Notebook, Python, and the Pandas library, I analyzed PyCity School district's data and showcased trends in school performance. During this analysis, I read raw data from CSV files, inspected and cleaned data, merged datasets, performed mathematical calculations, and visualized the data with charts and graphs to tell a story.

## Key Notes  
   - As a whole, schools with higher budgets, did not yield better test results. By contrast, schools with higher spending 645-675 per student actually underperformed      compared to schools with smaller budgets (585 per student).

   - As a whole, smaller and medium sized schools dramatically out-performed large sized schools on passing math performances (89-91% passing vs 67%).

   - As a whole, charter schools out-performed the public district schools across all metrics. However, more analysis will be required to glean if the effect is due to      school practices or the fact that charter schools tend to serve smaller student populations per school.
